This is another homework assignment. The goal of which is to implement
a simple checklist application in 24 hours.

I chose to use Google App Engine for my platform, although this should work
with most other platforms with very little modification. The backend is written
in Python and is essentially just an AJAX endpoint.

The frontend makes use of the following JavaScript libraries hosted at
third-party CDN (Content Distribution Networks):
- jQuery
- Handlebars.js
- Moment.js
- jQuery Tablesorter.
- Spin.js

The live application can be found at http://zzchecklist.appspot.com
